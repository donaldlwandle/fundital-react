  <li>React Context</li>
  <li>React Styled Components</li>
</ul>

## The User Interface:
###### I have built the following pages within this application: sign in, sign up, browse & lastly the homepage. There are four different pages, some using protected routes with auth listeners. I used compound components (just a design pattern) to build my components. The styling is all handled via styled components. Using compound components made my actual dumb components really easy to test.

## Data layer and Business Logic:
###### Firebase firestore handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook; authentication is used on all pages, which is handled by Firebase as well.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
